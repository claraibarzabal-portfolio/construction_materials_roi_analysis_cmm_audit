# construction_materials_roi_analysis_cmm_audit
A detailed analysis of the return on investment (ROI) for construction materials, including data cleaning, histogram analysis, and bar chart visualizations using `for` loops.

## üèóÔ∏è Construction Materials ROI Analysis & CMM Audit Analytics

### Project Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of the return on investment (ROI) for construction materials, focusing on data cleaning, histogram analysis, and bar chart visualizations using `for` loops. The project also includes an audit of CMM‚Äôs strategic decisions to identify the root causes of low ROI.

### Objective

- **Identify Issues:** Analyze and visually demonstrate the strategic deficiencies leading to low ROI for construction materials.
- **Investigate Causes:** Examine and explain the factors contributing to the low ROI, taking into account both CMM‚Äôs strategy and the economic context in Paraguay.

### Data

The project utilizes datasets in Excel, Looker, and Colab formats. Key data aspects include:
- **[Excel Files](https://github.com/claraibarzabal-portfolio/construction_materials_roi_analysis_cmm_audit/blob/main/roi_analysis.xlsx):** Detailed ROI data with various financial metrics and construction material details.
- **Looker Dashboard:** Visualizations and interactive analysis tools for exploring ROI data.
- **Colab Notebook:** Comprehensive data analysis, including data cleaning, histogram generation, and bar chart creation.

### Challenges

- **Low ROI Identification:** The project explores significant financial irregularities and strategic errors by CMM management that contributed to poor ROI.
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressing null values and ensuring data integrity for accurate analysis.

### Outcome

By thoroughly analyzing the ROI and CMM‚Äôs strategic decisions, this project provides actionable insights to enhance material cost efficiency and strategic planning in the construction industry.
